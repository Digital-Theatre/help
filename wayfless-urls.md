# WAYFless URLs


## What is a WAYFless URL?


> A WAYFless URL, which is specific to an institution with associated users and to a web-based service or resource, enables a user from that institution to gain federated access to the service or resource in a way that bypasses the ‘Where Are You From’ (WAYF) or Discovery Service step.
> Since a WAYF can be confusing and unpleasant to negotiate, bypassing it represents an improved end-user experience; this in turn can help organisations ensure that their users get best use of the services and resources that they provide.

See [Best Practice: WAYFless Access to Resources](https://www.ukfederation.org.uk/library/uploads/Documents/WAYFlessGuidance.pdf) on the UK Federation website for more.

On www.digitaltheatreplus.com the 'Where Are You From (WAYF)' step is on the right of this page:
