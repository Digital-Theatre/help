# Using Digital Theatre+ with Learning Management Systems

At the current time, we do not provide any specific LTI implementations.  This is on our long term roadmap.

## Using external URLs in your LMS

### Canvas

You may implement links to Digital Theatre+ URLs by adding an 'External URL' item to a module.

Currently, you will need to set the option to 'open in new tab' as the product does not allow embedding within iframes.  We are looking to change this in the immediate future.

Below is a screenshot of how the external URL configuration should be set:
