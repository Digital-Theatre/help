# Troubleshooting video playback

## Symptoms

1. **Frequent buffering** can occur when the Internet bandwidth available does not support playback.
2. **Failure to play** can occur when when your device is not properly authenticated or experiences network issues.
3. **Video stuttering** can occur if your device is unable to process the video data at the required rate.  This can cause video frames to be skipped and/or audio to become out of sync.

## Try these first

If you are experiencing video playback issues, please try the following:

### All types of issues

1. Try a different browser
1. Try using an Incognito or Private browser tab
1. Clear cache and cookies. If you need instructions how to do this, please refer to [clear-my-cache.com](https://clear-my-cache.com/)
1. Restart your computer
1. Make sure your browser is up-to-date - check the [what is my browser website](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/) - and confirm it says 'Your web browser is up to date'
1. If you are connected to the Internet over Wifi, confirm that you have a strong signal (at least -50 dBm) on an uncongested channel.  If you are unsure how to do this, please consult with your local Technology representative.

### Failure to play or stuttering video

1. Perform a speed test [using Fast.com](https://fast.com/). You will need at least 5Mbbps, ideally 10Mbps
1. Disable any browser extensions, plugins, or add ons
1. Close other browser tabs or applications - keeping too many applications open can make everything run slower, including video playback
1. Disable/enable hardware acceleration - hardware acceleration makes resource-hungry operations run more efficiently, but sometimes doesnâ€™t work well with older graphics cards. Try disabling or enabling this option within your browser settings
1. Connect to your network using a cable rather than wireless
1. Ensure that your graphics card drivers are up to date - your computer may be experiencing a graphics card driver issue that is interfering with video playback. Contact your computer manufacturer for help.
